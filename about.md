# About Me
I am a GAP 2020 Graduate  


I’ve never really enjoyed this heading or rather answering it but I know it’s an important question to answer. My hobbies and interests vary from month to month. 

Longer interests include the more common ones such as, exercising and playing team sports. I enjoy reading psychology and self-help books as well as those books on lists like top 100 books which one should read before they die. Lastly, I am very interested in cooking and find the discussion on food over medicine very interesting as well as all these fad diets. 

My more month to month hobbies are exploring these lifestyle changes. Examples include having a coffee fast or being part of that 5 am club, to trying out yoga and calisthenics and trying to complete a month of being alcohol free. 

The habits that stick I stay with; but the ones that fade are let loose. 


## Education

Pretoria Boys High School 
2010 - 2014

I attended PBHS in 2010. I had a great high school experience and learnt a lot of life lessons growing up in boarding school. I enjoyed sports and never neglected academics either. Made some life long friends too.

University of Stellenbosch
2015 – 2019

Finished up at Stellies with a BCom Hons in Statistics but I started my first year studying accounting. Had an inspiring university experience and feel like I discovered a lot about myself. Played rugby and water polo for various res leagues and also represented Maaties in their second team water polo “Vixs “. Never thought I’d ended up with a Statistics degree but I guess that’s how life works.
